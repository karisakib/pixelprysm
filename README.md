### Notes

The Next.js backend API's allow for data fetching using the /api directory within the /pages directory.

Backend API's will always reside in the /api directory. The logic is very similar to Express.js so when confused, think back to how Express.js handlers are implemented.

Since Next.js is a Full-Stack framework, it carries serv-erside capabilities such as filesystem traveral via the 'fs' module. Server-side node.js packages will work here.

The backend API files end in .ts file extension

The frontend components and pages end in .tsx file extension.
